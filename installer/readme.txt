Installer script for JetSQLConsole
==================================

This installer script requires the Nullsoft Scriptable Install Ststem
(http://nsis.sourceforge.net).  It also requires functionality for the
modification of the PATH environment variable: functions for this capability
may be found at http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Path_Manipulation, and are included
in the source file AddToPath.nsh in this directory.
